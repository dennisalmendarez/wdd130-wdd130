      <p>Hello, let me talk about me, I'm a member of the church since I was
        a kid, graduated from seminar, I currenyly live on Florida but I'm from Honduras
        I have lived here for the past 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>I'm studying software development since I always love computers and how they
        work, trying to learn what I love the most. my hobbies are reading light novels
        playing games and walking at night.
      </p>
      <p>I own a bird pet, it's really small but with a bad temperament that is almost funny
        when it gets mad, we are planning to have a cat soon and it's going to more fun everyday,
        my favorite movies are sc-fiction move and the best one is battle los Angeles.
      </p>
      <p>I currently work as a framer at a construction site, but I want to finish my 
        degree so I can look for a better job, I hope we all can get along and work
        together to have a better future. thanks for reading.
